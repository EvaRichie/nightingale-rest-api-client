# Nightingale collection format (NCF)

Nightingale can save your data in collection files (e.g. myCollection.ncf). These collection files are text-based, so you can open them in Notepad or any text editor to view the structure of the data. You can also share this data to anyone, just like any other text-based file like TXT or JSON files. And just like an other text-based file, you can double click on an NCF file to launch Nightingale and start sending requests. Simple, eh?

## How to create an NCF file

You can create an NCF file by clicking the `Save As` button at the top left of Nightingale's menu bar. A file picker will launch where you can select a destination for your NCF file.

## Saving NCF files in OneDrive

Just like Word documents or PowerPoint files, you might want to save your REST API collections on the cloud so that your data follows you across your different devices. You can do that with NCF files. Simply save/move/copy your NCF files to a OneDrive directory on your Windows 10 device, and it will be synced instantly to your cloud.

You can also save NCF files on your SharePoint or OneDrive for Business locations. Essentially, you can save NCF files anywhere! 

## Committing NCF files in Git repositories

NCF files are text-based, so you can treat them like any other text files: you can add them to your git repository! This is a great way to share collection files between teams, especially if the collection files are related to the code in the repository. 

First, save/move/copy your NCF file to a git-initialized directory.

Then commit the files.
