# Request Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## Trying to connnect to localhost?

1. Try turning off SSL validation in Nightingale's settings. Click the gear icon at the top right corner of Nightingale and turn off the SSL validation toggle.

2. If the above doesn't work, you might be hitting a known limitation for modern Windows apps. [try the workaround command in here](https://github.com/jenius-apps/nightingale-rest-api-client/blob/master/docs/localhost.md).
