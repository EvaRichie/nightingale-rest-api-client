# Nightingale REST API client - Privacy Policy

### How We Collect and Use Information

**Information you add into the app:**

You input information such as URLs and query parameters into the app that is used to complete the REST API calls. None of this information is personally identifiable.

**How we use the information you add into the app:**

The information you input into the app is only transmitted as part of the REST API request that you defined. They are not transmitted elsewhere, such as our servers or third-party servers. They are simply used to perform the REST API call.

**Analytics information:**

We may record crash analytics and usage information, such as the number of times the settings page was visited or the number of times a request was sent. This data is anonymous and is not traceable to an individual. This information is tracked to determine which features are being used so as to help guide what types of features to add or remove in the future. The data that you input into the app, such as URLs of requests, are not tracked. Crash analytics and usage information can be disabled in Nightingale's settings.

### How We Store Your Information

The information you add into the app is saved in a database file in your local device. You are responsible for safeguarding your device to protect your information. We are not responsible for any confidential information. This data is not transmitted to a remote location by Nightingale. 

### Ways Your Information May Be Transmitted to Another Location

You can choose to export your data into an NCF file. This file is simply a text file of your workspace information. You can save this file anywhere, such as on a USB drive or your own cloud storage. At this point, it's outside Nightingale's domain and it's your responsibility to control your data's security.
